## HTMX Collection Posting

This is a simple demo on the surface but demonstrates a few complex concepts in ASP.NET Core:

- Model Binding a collection from a form
- Sorting client side and saving the results
- Clientside interaction with HTMX
- Document Database

## Getting Started

You'll need the following:

- PostgreSQL Database (use docker)
- .NET 6

You should be good to go. Just change the connection string.
